    Call ``beater.beat()`` as often as you like. Files will only be uploaded

    beat.

    Parameters
    ----------
    handle : `str`
        The name of the channel to which the heartbeat corresponds.
    uploadPeriod : `float`
        The time, in seconds, which must have passed since the last successful
        heartbeat for a new upload to be undertaken.
    flatlinePeriod : `float`
        If a new heartbeat is not received before the flatlinePeriod elapses,
