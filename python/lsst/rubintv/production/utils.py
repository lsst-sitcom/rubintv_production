    Some packages which aren't distributed with any metapackage are required
    to run RubinTV. This function is used to check if they're present so
    that unprotected imports don't cause the package to fail to import. It also
    allows checking in a singple place, given that all are necessary for
    RubinTV's running.

    Parameters
    ----------
    exitIfNotFound : `bool`
        Terminate execution if imports are not present? Useful in bin scripts.
    logger : `logging.Log`
        The logger used to warn is packages are not present.
